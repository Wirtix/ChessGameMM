# Chess Game
## Desc:
This is game based on Checkers game from online tutorial. I decided to not use any library focused on chess and do moves by myself.
This is the reason why code is so long but it shows my fundamental understanding of Python 
I have used MiniMax algorithm with Alpha beta optimalization.
